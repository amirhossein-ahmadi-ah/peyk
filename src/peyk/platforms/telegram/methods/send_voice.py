    """Use this method to send audio files, if you want Telegram clients to display the file as a playable voice message. For this to work, your audio must be in an .OGG file encoded with OPUS, or in .MP3 format, or in .M4A format (other formats may be sent as Audio or Document). On success, the sent Message is returned. Bots can currently send voice messages of up to 50 MB in size, this limit may be changed in the future.

Args:
    chat_id: Unique identifier for the target chat or username of the target bot, supergroup or channel in the format @username
    voice: Audio file to send. Pass a file_id as String to send a file that exists on the Telegram servers (recommended), pass an HTTP URL as a String for Telegram to get a file from the Internet, or upload a new one using multipart/form-data. More information on Sending Files
    caption: Voice message caption, 0-1024 characters after entities parsing
    parse_mode: Mode for parsing entities in the voice message caption. See formatting options for more details.
    caption_entities: A JSON-serialized list of special entities that appear in the caption, which can be specified instead of parse_mode
    duration: Duration of the voice message in seconds
    message_thread_id: Unique identifier for the target message thread (topic) of a forum; for forum supergroups and private chats of bots with forum topic mode enabled only
    disable_notification: Sends the message silently. Users will receive a notification with no sound.
    protect_content: Protects the contents of the sent message from forwarding and saving
    reply_parameters: Description of the message to reply to
    reply_markup: Additional interface options. A JSON-serialized object for an inline keyboard, custom reply keyboard, instructions to remove a reply keyboard or to force a reply from the user.

Returns:
